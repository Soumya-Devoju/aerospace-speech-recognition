# Aerospace Speech Recognition Dataset 🎤✈️

This repository contains a **Mini Speech Commands Dataset** used for developing an **Aerospace AI/ML Speech Recognition System** — part of my internship under **Edunet Foundation & AICTE Green Skills Initiative**.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This dataset consists of short (1-second) voice recordings of spoken commands such as:

- **up** → Increase Altitude  
- **down** → Decrease Altitude  
- **go** → Start Engine  
- **stop** → Hold/Stop Movement  
- **left** → Turn Left  
- **right** → Turn Right  
- **yes** / **no** → Control Confirmation  

These speech commands can be used to train AI models for:
- Voice-controlled aerospace or drone operations  
- ATC (Air Traffic Control) communication assistance  
- Pilot voice command systems
